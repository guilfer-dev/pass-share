# StreamShare

Easy way to share access (and bills) with your friends and family.

When trying to find something similar, I found this paid platform https://www.kotas.com.br/.
My idea is to make an open source version, easy to upload to the cloud or an Raspberry Pi.

The MVP for this project can be found under the branch "MVP".

### Keep in mind that the branch "gb-pages is used only for the deploy here in GitHub. If you try to use this branch, chances are that you will currupt the project cloned into your machine.
